# Svelte/Webpack/Express proof of concept

This is just the result of trying to get Svelte to work with Webpack and Express. I decided to use the [Anagramica API](http://www.anagramica.com/api), which returns possible anagrams for letter combinations.

## Features

- [**Svelte**](https://svelte.dev/) - compiled component JS framework
- [**Webpack**](https://webpack.js.org/) - JS module bundler, for compiling Svelte components
- [**ExpressJS**](https://expressjs.com/) - NodeJS server
- [**Got**](https://github.com/sindresorhus/got) - HTTP request library for NodeJS

## Setup

- `npm install`
- `npm run start`
